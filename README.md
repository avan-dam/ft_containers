The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. 
To make sure you understand them all, letâ€™s re-implement them!


**Usage:**

I have included a main which compares my containers with STL containers

To test run the following commands in the terminal

```
git clone //https://github.com/avan-dam/ft_containers.git
cd ft_containers
make
```

This can be seen in the screenshot below
